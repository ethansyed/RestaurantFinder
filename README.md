Not exactly sure of the direction I will be going in for this project as of now

Will either serve as an API or web app that will take in a location from a user
and utilize reddit to find some of the best local restaurants

Once I have the first part working I want to cross reference the spots with reviews on google maps
and ensure the resturants are above an arbitrary x / 5 rating
